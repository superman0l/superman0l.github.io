Rasterization 光栅化
Project geometry primitives (3D triangles / polygons) onto the screen (generally 30 frames per second)
Curves and Meshes 几何
How to represent geometry in Computer Graphics
Ray Tracing 光线追踪
Shoot rays from the camera through each pixel
Animation/Simulation
Key frame Animation

Vector
Generally vectors are expressed by column.
Dot Product can measure how close two directions are.
Cross Product can determine a vector is in another vector's left/right or a dot is in a surface's inside or outside.

Matrix-Vector Multiplication
Treat vector as a column matrix (m * 1)\

vector multiplication in matrix form
dot product - transposition a
cross product - dual matrix of vector a
